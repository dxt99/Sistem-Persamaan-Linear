## matrix.java:

### public functions:

read(k): k=1 reads augmented matrix, k=0 reads square matrix;

outFloat(k): outputs k(float)

outMat(): outputs this.mat (entire matrix)

outPers(): outputs matrix equation solution (make sure this is augmented)

### issues:

- library(?)

## interpolation.java:

### public functions:

read(): reads points

out(): outputs polynomial and predicted value

### issues:

- might not be able to produce a polynomial (bad input)

## regression.java:

### public functions:

read(): reads n samples of size (n+1) each + 1 sample (of size n)

out(): outputs equation and predicted value

## issues:

- not compatible with case study (sample size too large)
